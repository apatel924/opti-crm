# 👁️ OptiVue - Optometry Management System

**OptiVue** is a modern, full-stack clinic management system built for optometrists and clinic staff. It is designed to streamline and digitize patient workflows, reduce operational friction, and centralize data across appointments, lab work, examinations, billing, and communications.

This project is being built from the ground up using **Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS**, with a backend to be developed alongside it. Each feature and component is modular, scalable, and version-controlled with atomic GitHub commits.

OptiVue embraces continuous improvement — the app will be upgraded progressively to **React 19** standards and best practices as they are adopted.
